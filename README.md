# Plume_Detection_with_DBSCAN

This repository contains a demo of code used to detect plumes in mobile air quality monitoring time series.

### Overview
To address plume detection in time series, we recast the problem as an anomaly detection problem and visualize plumes as anomalies scattered outwards from an n-dimensional origin. A graphical example of this concept is provided here:
